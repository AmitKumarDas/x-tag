<h4>Hey there!</h4>
<p>
	All this content was loaded async. Components with request object bindings, like <code>panel</code>, 
	have default attributes set for readystate and status code values. The background-color animation 
	you just witnessed was a CSS transition targeted at the automatically set <code>data-readystate</code> attribute.
